# FEWD Final Project

Thanks for checking out my final project. This project allows users to access statistics for the videogame Tom Clancy's Rainbow SixÂ® Siege by entering their username and the platform that they play the game on!



### Getting started
Since there is no back-end for this project (yet...), you'll need to install a package in orer to connect to the API:

```npm i rainbowsix-api-node --save```

You can find more information about this package at https://github.com/27therealone/rainbowsix-api-node



### Testing data
In case for some reason you don't play this game, you will need some credentials to text with:

| Username        | Platform           |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| AzzWhooper    | uplay | 
| Hardpaint      | uplay      | 
| TazzZMan630 | ps4      |
| TangyD-PENTA    | uplay | 
| Don_vito_710      | ps4      | 
| TwitchisMyBae | xbox 1      |
